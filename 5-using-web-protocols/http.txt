- Basically, web protocols define the way clients and servers communicate with each other.
- The protocol used between the browser (or client) and the server is HTTP
- HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a unidirectional client/server protocol in which the HTTP client makes HTTP requests to the HTTP server and the server responds with an HTTP response.
- You can use headers to pass additional meta information to HTTP requests and HTTP responses.
- HTTP methods define what action should be performed on the HTTP server.
- The status code of an HTTP response defines whether an HTTP request could be processed successfuly or not.
- MIME types define the format of the data that is transferred via an HTTP request or an HTTP response.
- Polling and long polling are techniques by which a client pols data from the server at regular intervals. The communication is unidirectional from the client to the server.
- SSEs alow data to be actively sent from the server to the client.
- The communication is unidirectional from the server to the client.
- The WebSocket protocol is a bidirectional client/server protocol where the WebSocket client can send data to the WebSocket server, but the server can also actively send data to the client, provided that the client has previously established a WebSocket connection to the server.
